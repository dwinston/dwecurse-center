# Welcome to Dwecurse Center

This is where I (Donny W.) write about recursing, recurses about writing, etc.

## Why?

I am attending the [Recurse Center](//recurse.com) "Winter 1" batch (Nov 4 - Feb 13). My main goal is to learn a lot and
get better at programming. A secondary goal is to develop a habit of writing in order to organize thoughts, clarify
ideas, and reflect on what I've learned. This site is a repository of such writing that I hope to be able to search and
share.
