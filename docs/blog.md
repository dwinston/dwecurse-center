# "Blog"

This page is a log of thoughts that I am yet to organize into pages. Maybe I'll discover that I should have a proper
 blog, but for now this is a lightweight approximation that seems fine.

My first day at RC was a whirlwind. I enjoyed it, but definitely high-energy. Met a lot of folks in a well-organized way
(a handful of three-minute pairings with others), and then had lunch in a group of eight. When I got back to RC around
2:15, the Big Open hit me. What now? I went on Zulip, signed up for pairing and coffee chats with the respective bots,
and went through email. I poured a cup of coffee for myself and decided to browse the book jackets of RC's tiny
 library in anticipation of a moment during my batch when I'm puzzled and then have a "wait -- there's a book here on
  that!" realization. Time will tell.
  
My idea for a first project is to (1) get familiar with the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language and then (2) write
a toy [density functional theory (DFT) code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory ) in it
Specifically, I want to (2a) review Mikael Kuisma's [DFT code in one hour with
MATLAB](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyifek164UUJk8PplzS56VvWZM8KgFqbk) and Tomas Arias' [Practical
DFT](http://jdftx.org/PracticalDFT.html) six-lecture mini-course (taught in Octave, an open-source MATLAB equivalent),
and then (2b) adapt the given code to Julia. These sources in particular seem useful because Julia is often marketed as
an "upgrade" to MATLAB (offering familiar syntax) for people. Thus, I should have some room to think about code
organization/design and not need to dwell much on low-level details that that be surmised from the MATLAB/Octave code
. I am hoping that I can accomplish all of the above in two weeks, one week for (1) and then another week for (2a-b).
